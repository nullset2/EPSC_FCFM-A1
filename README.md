# EPSC_FCFM-A1
Assignment 1 for EPSC at FCFM UANL, MX, in ruby. Yeah, I'm completely aware that's a linked list in ruby. Yeah, I know it's redundant since Array already has all the yummy Linked List secret sauce baked in. Yeah, it was a requirement.

Hopefully this can help any other people in the future become more proficient with object-oriented Ruby, or to deal with the course. The instructor has a plagiarism detection scheme in place, btw, so I wouldn't just rip off the code and present it as my own, but... I guess that's up to your judgement, or lack of it.
